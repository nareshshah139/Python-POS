    - Customer ID
      - Checks whether Customer ID exists in database. If not please create new customer and use the ID provided.
    - Payment Method
    - Product selected from dropdown (new products will follow in version 2.2.3)
    - Sales amount (only positive numbers up to 500, anything above needs to be paid under the table)
    - Also displays the current date in case you forgot.
New Customer View
  - Let's you create new customers. Enter name - get customer ID.
Report View
  -BI Reporting to show Total Sales by Day broken down by payment method and top selling Products.
CRM View
  - Shows Total Sales amounts during the past day, broken down by payment method. Chart displays sales for the top customers during the last day.
