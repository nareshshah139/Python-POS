# Python-POS

Things to start thinking about for submission #2:
1. File handling, storage and reopening 
2. Error Logging and removing all prints
3. GUI Interface 

Need to connect commands across components.
Need to clean up GUI code.
Need to comment code.
Maybe add buttons for checks.
Maybe add buttons for creating new user.
